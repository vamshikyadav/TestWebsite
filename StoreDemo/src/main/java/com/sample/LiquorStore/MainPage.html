		<h2>Main Content</h2>
		<p>The Georgia Department of Labor (GDOL) receives many inquiries
			for help with various employment issues; however, resolution of most
			workplace problems is the responsibility of several federal agencies.
			The U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division is responsible
			for laws and regulations in Title II and Title III of the Americans
			with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibit discrimination on the
			basis of disability in all services, programs, and activities
			provided to the public by state and local governments and in "places
			of public accommodation." It also coordinates and ensures consistent
			and effective enforcement of Section 504 and Section 508 of the
			Rehabilitation Act.</p>
